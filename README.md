Angela Yu's Udemy Course : https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code

This repository has my python notes and projects I made while taking this course. Feel free to check out my projects and let me know if there are any mistakes. 
Thank you!

This repository is inspired by [@Matthew1906](https://www.github.com/Matthew1906)'s Python notes repository. I found the file structure to be very convenient. However, the notes and projects are all built by me. I will additionally add any important features that I find is required.
