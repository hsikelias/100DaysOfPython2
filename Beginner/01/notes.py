print("What's up")

# this is a print function,  what u want to print is between the double quotes.
# the key word here is print

# adding things inside the double quotes tells the computer that whatever is inside it
# is not a code, its called STRING. Double quotes show the beginning and end of the string.

# when you face an error, just copy paste it to google and use sources like stackoverflow to get answers. 
# Every porgrammer makes a mistake, you just have to be good at figuring out the problem.

# not just double quotes we can also use single quotes

print('"Hello"')
print("Hey's")

#\n This moves the next string to new line
print("Yeezy season approachin \nfk what yall been hearin")

# concataate strings
