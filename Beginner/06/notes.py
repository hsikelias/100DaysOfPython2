# FUNCTIONS

print() # functions are followed by ()
print("Hello World")

# but, how to make own functions?

# start with def key word, it defines its the function

def my_function():
  print("Hello")
  print("Bye Bye")

my_function()

# Defining Functions

# def do_thisfunction():

   # DO THIS
   # THEN THIS
   # FINALLY THIS

# calling the function
   # do_thisfunction()


# WHILE LOOPS

# a loop that continues to happen while the condition is true or it just runs infinitely no matter what.

while 2 == 2:
  print("2 + 2 is 5 fight me")

# for loops are great if you want to iterate over individual things in a list.
# while loops do things repeatedly, if you're not careful u might end up with a infinite loop.
